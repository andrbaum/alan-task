   *
   * That's the tricky one!
   *
   *
   * I would like you to figure out how to write tests yourself! Look ad the Core test for inspiration.
   *
   * The idea is pretty straight forward , use test("...") {} constructor , where the {} need to result in an assertion.
   * The tests will run in parallel because of the power of the IO.
   *
   * The idea is that you want to mock your db , create PokemonRoutes instance and then run requests against those routes
   * asserting that the responses are what you are after.
